# Project Euler by Dynortice

This repo contains solutions of problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Solutions written on R, Python and Julia languages.

Each directory of problem contains compute.R, compute.py and compute.jl files. It's just function for solution of that problem. Also there're solution.ipynb, solution.rmd, solution.jl which provides some math theory and examples with benchmarking.

My PC configuration: Windows 10 Pro x64, Intel Core i7-9750H, DDR4-3200. Python 3.8.2, R 4.0.2, Julia 1.5.0.
