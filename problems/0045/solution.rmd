## Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle $T_n = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$ $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...$

Pentagonal $P_n = \frac{n (3n - 1)}{2}$ $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...$

Hexagonal $H_n = n (2n - 1)$ $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

OEIS Sequence: [A046180](https://oeis.org/A046180)

## Solution
```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
setwd("../../")
source("euler/R/calculus.R")
```
```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    i <- hexagonal_index(n) + 1
    while (((sqrt(48 * i ^ 2 - 24 * i + 1) + 1) / 6) %% 1 != 0) i <- i + 1
    return(get_hexagonal(i))
}
```
```{r}
compute(40755)
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute(40755))
```
