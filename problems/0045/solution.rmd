## Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle $T_n = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$ $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...$

Pentagonal $P_n = \frac{n (3n - 1)}{2}$ $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...$

Hexagonal $H_n = n (2n - 1)$ $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

## Solution
```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
setwd("../../")
source("euler/R/calculus.R")
```
```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    n <- get_hexagonal(144)
    i <- n - 40755
    while (TRUE) {
        if (is.pentagonal(n)) {
            return(n)
        }
        i <- i + 4
        n <- n + i
    }
}
```
```{r}
compute()
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute())
```
