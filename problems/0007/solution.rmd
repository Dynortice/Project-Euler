## $10001$st prime
By listing the first six prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$ and $13$, we can see that the $6$th prime is $13$.

What is the $10 001$st prime number?

## Solution
Using sieve of Eratosthenes we could find $10001$st prime number by index. Under $100$ millions there more than $5%$ prime numbers. Therefore we can use sieve with size of $20n$.

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
setwd("../../")
source("euler/R/primes.R")
```

```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    return(get_primes(n * 20)[n])
}
```

```{r}
compute(6)
```

```{r}
compute(10001)
```

```{r}
microbenchmark(compute(10001))
```
