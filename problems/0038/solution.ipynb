    "\n",
    "The same can be achieved by starting with $9$ and multiplying by $1, 2, 3, 4$, and $5$, giving the pandigital, $918273645$, which is the concatenated product of $9$ and $(1,2,3,4,5)$.\n",

    "What is the largest $1$ to $9$ pandigital $9$-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with $(1,2, ... , n)$ where $n > 1$?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find a $9$-digit pandigital number greater than the given $918273645$, which implies that the first digit of the concatenated number starts with 9 as well. Since $n > 1$, the trivial solution of $987654321 \\times 1$ is not allowed and with $n$ being at least two, the maximum digit count of the fixed number $x$ is forced to be $\\le 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fixed number $x$ is a two-digit number, all resulting numbers will have $<9$ digits with $n \\le 3$ and $>9$ with $n \\ge 4$, which allows us to exclude the range $90 \\le x < 100$. If the fixed number $x$ is a three-digit number, all resulting numbers will be $\\ne 9$ as well, which excludes the range $900 \\le x < 1000$. Finally, if $x$ is a four-digit number, we will get a $9$ digit number, which leaves us with the first rough valid range of $9000 \\le x < 10000$. This interval can be reduced to valid pandigital values, which results in an interval of $9123 \\le x \\le 9876$. If we check again the length argument, we can lift the lower bound to $9213$, since $9123$ will not result in a $9$ digit number, which gives the new interval $9213 \\le x \\le 9876$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When digging a little deeper, we see that if the second digit is $>4$, a carry over happens and two $9$s are produced in the solution. A similar observation shows that non of the digits can be $1$ since we will otherwise end up with two $1$s in the solution. This allows us to further reduce the search space to $9234 \\le x \\le 9487$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplied by two, the interval is $18468 \\le x \\le 18974$, which says that concatenating $x$ and $2x$ can be done with $100000x + 2x$ or better $100002x$."
