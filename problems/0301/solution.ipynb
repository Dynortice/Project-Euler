    "\n",
    "*Nim* is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stone remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:\n",
    "- At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.\n",
    "- On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.\n",
    "- The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ that returns:\n",
    "- zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or\n",
    "- non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example $X(1, 2, 3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To ilustrate:\n",
    "- current player moves to $(1, 2, 1)$\n",
    "- opponent moves to $(1, 0, 1)$\n",
    "- current player moves to $(0, 0, 1)$\n",
    "- opponent moves to $(0, 0, 0)$, and so wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "For how many positive integers $n \\le 2^{30}$ does $X(n, 2n, 3n) = 0$?\n",
