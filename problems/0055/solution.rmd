## Lychrel numbers

If we take $47$, reverse and add, $47 + 74 = 121$, which is palindromic.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

$$349 + 943 = 1292$$

$$1292 + 2921 = 4213$$

$$4213 + 3124 = 7337$$

That is, $349$ took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like $196$, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$ iterations, $28$-digits).

Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is $4994$.

How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on $24$ April $2007$ to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

source("euler/R/numbers.R")
```
```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    result <- 0
    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
        number <- as.bigint(i)
        number %+=% as.bigint(intToUtf8(rev(utf8ToInt(number$str))))
        j <- 1
        while ((j <= 50) & (!is.palindrome(number))) {
            number %+=% as.bigint(intToUtf8(rev(utf8ToInt(number$str))))
            j <- j + 1
        }
        if (j > 50) {
            result <- result + 1
