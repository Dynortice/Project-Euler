## Counting summations

It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

$$4 + 1$$

$$3 + 2$$

$$3 + 1 + 1$$

$$2 + 2 + 1$$

$$2 + 1 + 1 + 1$$

$$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$$

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

## Solution

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
```

```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    combinations <- c(1, rep(0, n))
    for (i in 1:n) {
        for (j in (i + 1):(n + 1)) {
            combinations[j] <- combinations[j] + combinations[j - i]
        }
    }
    return(combinations[n + 1] - 1)
}
```

```{r}
compute(5)
```
```{r}
compute(100)
```

```{r}
microbenchmark(compute(100))
```
