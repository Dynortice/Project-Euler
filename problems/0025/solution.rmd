## $1000$-digit Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2} \text{ where } F_1 = 1 \text{ and } F_2 = 1.$$

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$F_1 = 1$$

$$F_2 = 1$$

$$F_3 = 2$$

$$F_4 = 3$$

$$F_5 = 5$$

$$F_6 = 8$$

$$F_7 = 13$$

$$F_8 = 21$$

$$F_9 = 34$$

$$F_{10} = 55$$

$$F_{11} = 89$$

$$F_{12} = 144$$

The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?

## Solution
```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
```
```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    return(ceiling((log(10) * (n - 1) + log(5) / 2) / log((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)))
}
```
```{r}
compute(3)
```
```{r}
compute(1000)
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute(1000))
```
