## Large non-Mersenne prime

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in $1999$, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593}−1$; it contains exactly $2098960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p−1$, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in $2004$ there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2357207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

## Solution
```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
setwd("../../")
source("euler/R/big_int.R")
```
```{r}
compute <- function() {
    return((pow(as.bigint(2), 7830457, "10000000000") * 28433) %% "10000000000" + 1)
}
```
```{r}
compute()
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute())
```
