## Large non-Mersenne prime

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in $1999$, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593}−1$; it contains exactly $2098960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p−1$, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in $2004$ there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2357207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

## Solution
```{r}
source("../../euler/R/big_int.R")
library(microbenchmark)
```
```{r}
compute <- function() {
    result <- BigInt$new("2")$pow(7830457, 10)$mul(BigInt$new("28433"))$add(BigInt$new("1"))$str
    return(substr(result, nchar(result) - 9, nchar(result)))
}
```
```{r}
compute()
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute())
```
