## Lattice paths
Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.<br/><br/>

<center><img src = 'https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p015.png' title = 'Lattice paths'></center><br/>

How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?

## Solution

This paths just Pascal's triangle, so we can find answer just using binomial coefficient.
```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
```
```{r}
compute <- function(n) {
    return(choose(2 * n, n))
}
```
```{r}
compute(2)
```
```{r}
compute(20)
```
```{r}
microbenchmark(compute(20))
```
